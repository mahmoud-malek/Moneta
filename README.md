## Story & Inspiration
The inspiration behind Moneta came from the need for a simple and easy-to-use expense tracker that helps people manage their finances. I Was inspired to create Moneta after struggling with Excel spreadsheets, word documents, and papers to track my expenses and income.

I wanted to create a tool that would make it easy for people to track their finances and make better financial decisions. as a result, Moneta was born. I worked on Moneta alone, and it took me about 3 weeks to design and develop the application.

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, and Python with Flask for the back-end.
I also used MySQl as the database. I chose these technologies because I am familiar with them and have experience working with them. I also wanted to keep the application simple and lightweight, so I avoided using complex frameworks and libraries.
